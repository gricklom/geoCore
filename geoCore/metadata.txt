about=geoCore creates graphical representations of geoscientific drillings. The plugin depends on PyYAML (https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) and naturally on QGIS and thus PyQt. geoCore was developed in cooperation with the Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research (NIhK). The NIhK provides the domain specific knowledge and is key driver for the plugin's feature set. For the citation options see the manual. !!!Backup your config.yml and geoCore.yml before you update the plugin!!!
